TM_FIRMWARE_VERSION 0xFEDA0005
DESCRIPTION This is firmware version 0xFEDA0005, which is the up-to-date version for TARGET 7 modules as of Feb 11, 2016. The change compared to the previous firmware version 0xFEDA0004 is a fix for a bug affecting the ExtTriggerDirection bit.

EthernetPacketSize		0x17	7		24		0x0		  0			 0x0		0x7F	   0.		  0.	 Maximum Ethernet packet size parameter. Indicate how many channels out of available 64 can be shipped in one packet. Value of 0 and 1 indicate one channel per network packet, 2  channels  per  packet,  and  … Careful attention need to be taken to set this parameter. First of all user need to know type of network card host system will have and if it support Jumbo packets. In any case maximum size of acceptable network packet need to be compared with expected event size and properly divided into packets. Default value of 0 (or 1) always process just one channel per packet and works in all cases but will generate maximum number of packets (64). This parameter help to reduce number of packets and related overhead for packet header and trailer to optimize system performance.
