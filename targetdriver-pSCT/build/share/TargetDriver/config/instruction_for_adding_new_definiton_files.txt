You  should adapt the following naming convention while adding new definition files:

===============================
ASICs:

TX_ASIC.def (e.g., T5_ASIC.def)

===============================
FIRMWARE FOR THE FPGA's:

Evaluation boards:

TX_EB_FPGA_Firmware0x... (e.g., TC_EB_FPGA_Firmware0xFEDA0014.def)

Camera modules:

* normal (i.e., backplane compatible) firmware

TX_M_FPGA_Firmware0x... (e.g., T7_M_FPGA_Firmware0xB0000102.def)

* standalone firmware

TX_MSA_FPGA_Firmware0x... (e.g., T7_MSA_FPGA_Firmware0xFEDA0005.def)

==================================================
*  By default: Do not introduce different names for settings that were already avaible in previous versions of the definition files. Even if your newer name is better. 
*If you really really really insist, you have to go through all the definition files and change it, also you need to look for all instances where this setting is called in the code and replace it and inform all users that this change has been made. 
* If parts of a register are unsed, us the following convention Unused_<reg addr.>_<optional coutner>: i.e. Unused_0x3c if there is only one part of the register not being used, and Unused_0x3c_0,  Unused_0x3c_1, etc etc when there are multiple sections in one register not used. Collect subsequent unused but in one <Unused> setting
